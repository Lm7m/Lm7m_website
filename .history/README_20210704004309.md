# Lm7m's Portfolio

Welcome to the repo containing my personal portfolio web page. This project is designed using React and hosted and operated using a Django backend. This wesbite serves as a gentle introduction to who I am and to the work that I do. I have included a number of projects that I have worked on as well as their GitHub repos in the website.

## Technical Aspects

As mentioned above, this website is fully made using React and a number of react libraries such as helmet. The following are details on some of the libraries that I have used and their usage:

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **emailjs** | The main library that powers the 'contact me' form. This library is used to make API calls to the emailjs service so that emails would be forwarded to me. The choice of using this library came from research into this and doing risk assesment on what could happen if the sending service is implemented on the frontend.       |
