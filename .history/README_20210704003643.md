# Lm7m's Portfolio

Welcome to the repo containing my personal portfolio web page. This project is designed using React and hosted and operated using a Django backend. This wesbite serves as a gentle introduction to who I am and to the work that I do. I have included a number of projects that I have worked on as well as their GitHub repos in the website.
